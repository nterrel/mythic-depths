# Mythic Depths
### This is a simple RPG I'm coding for fun in python
Honestly not sure what I want to do with this, probably just a basic dungeon crawler for starters
Eventually write in a story of some kind.

Things to add:
- Character creation
- Items:
   - Food
   - Potions
   - Scrolls for spells
- Stats:
   - Magic to start, but eventually a rs-like combat triangle?

Clearly need to learn more about writing with markdown -- part of what I want to get out of this project.
