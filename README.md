# Mythic Depths
### This is a simple RPG I'm coding for fun in python
Honestly not sure what I want to do with this, probably just a basic dungeon crawler for starters
Eventually write in a story of some kind.

Things to add:
    * Character creation
    * Items:
        - Food
        - Potions
        - Scrolls for spells
    * Stats:
        - Magic to start, but eventually a rs-like combat triangle?
        -
